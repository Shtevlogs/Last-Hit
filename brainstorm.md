# Brainstorm Template for Plan Development

## Subject Overview
[Provide a brief overview of the subject matter here. This should include context, background, and any relevant information that will help the AI understand what needs to be planned.]

**What to include:**
- The core topic or challenge
- Relevant background or context
- Any constraints or known parameters
- What you hope to achieve with these plans
- Any specific areas of focus or concern

## Instructions for AI

You are tasked with analyzing the subject overview above and developing **2-3 well-realized plans** that address the key aspects of this subject. 

### CRITICAL: Conversational, Iterative Approach

**You MUST follow an evolving, conversational, single-question single-answer methodology:**

1. **Start with ONE focused question** - Ask only one question at a time to gather information
2. **Wait for the answer** - Do not proceed until you receive a response to your question
3. **Build understanding incrementally** - Use each answer to inform your next question
4. **Evolve the conversation** - Let the dialogue naturally progress from understanding desires → identifying issues → exploring solutions → developing plans
5. **No assumptions** - Don't generate plans until you have sufficient information through the Q&A process

### Question Quality Guidelines

Good questions should be:
- **Focused**: One specific aspect at a time
- **Open-ended**: Encourage detailed responses (avoid yes/no when possible)
- **Contextual**: Reference previous answers when relevant
- **Progressive**: Build on what you've already learned

**Example progression:**
- ❌ "What are your goals and challenges?" (too broad, multiple questions)
- ✅ "What is the primary outcome you're hoping to achieve with this project?"
- ✅ "Based on that outcome, what would you consider the biggest obstacle to reaching it?"

### Handling Information Gaps

- If information is unclear, ask a clarifying question rather than making assumptions
- If you believe you have enough information for a phase, you may ask: "Do you have any other [desires/issues/constraints] to share, or should we proceed?"
- Always err on the side of asking one more question rather than proceeding with incomplete understanding
- When answers are vague, ask for specific examples or details to deepen understanding

### Conversation Flow Structure

Follow this iterative process:

#### Phase 1: Understanding Desires
- Ask **one question at a time** about goals, aspirations, or desired outcomes
- Wait for answer, then ask the next clarifying question
- **Transition criteria**: Move to Phase 2 when you have identified 3-5 clear desires/goals
- Continue until you have a clear picture of key desires

#### Phase 2: Identifying Issues
- Ask **one question at a time** about challenges, obstacles, or concerns
- Build on previous answers to dig deeper
- **Transition criteria**: Move to Phase 3 when you have identified 3-5 key issues or challenges
- Continue until you understand the key issues

#### Phase 3: Exploring Solutions
- Ask **one question at a time** about constraints, preferences, or context
- Use answers to shape potential approaches
- **Transition criteria**: Move to Phase 4 when you understand constraints, resources, and have enough context to develop distinct approaches
- Continue until you have enough information to develop plans

#### Phase 4: Developing Plans
- Present **one plan at a time** for discussion
- Ask clarifying questions about each plan before moving to the next
- Refine plans based on feedback
- **Transition criteria**: Move to Phase 5 when you have developed 2-3 distinct, well-formed plans

#### Phase 5: Comparison & Refinement
- Ask questions to understand priorities and trade-offs
- Present comparison and recommendations
- Ask for final feedback or refinements
- **Transition criteria**: Complete when user confirms satisfaction or requests final document compilation

### Plan Structure (to be developed through conversation)

Each of the 2-3 plans should eventually include:

- **Plan Name**: A clear, descriptive title
- **Overview**: Brief summary of the approach
- **Key Desires Addressed**: Which desires this plan targets
- **Key Issues Addressed**: Which issues this plan tackles, avoids, or minimizes
- **Core Strategy**: The main approach or methodology
- **Implementation Steps**: 
  - Phase 1: [Initial steps]
  - Phase 2: [Development steps]
  - Phase 3: [Execution steps]
  - [Additional phases as needed]
- **Success Metrics**: How to measure progress and success
- **Potential Challenges**: Anticipated obstacles and mitigation strategies
- **Resource Requirements**: What's needed (time, skills, capital, tools, etc.)

### Final Output: Plan Comparison

After developing all plans through conversation, provide:
- **Comparison Matrix**: Side-by-side comparison of the plans
- **Recommended Use Cases**: When each plan is most appropriate
- **Hybrid Approach**: If applicable, how elements from different plans could be combined

---

## Output Format

**IMPORTANT**: The final output should be structured as follows, but it should be developed through the conversational Q&A process described above, not generated all at once.

### During Conversation:
- Ask **one question at a time**
- Wait for answers before proceeding
- Build understanding incrementally
- Reference previous answers in your questions

### Final Document Structure (after conversation completes):

# [Subject Name] - Strategic Plans

## Executive Summary
[Brief overview of all plans developed through conversation]

## Key Desires Identified
1. [Desire 1 - discovered through Q&A]
2. [Desire 2 - discovered through Q&A]
3. [etc.]

## Key Issues Identified
1. [Issue 1 - discovered through Q&A]
2. [Issue 2 - discovered through Q&A]
3. [etc.]

## Plan 1: [Plan Name]
[Full plan details following the structure above, refined through conversation]

## Plan 2: [Plan Name]
[Full plan details following the structure above, refined through conversation]

## Plan 3: [Plan Name] (if applicable)
[Full plan details following the structure above, refined through conversation]

## Plan Comparison & Recommendations
[Comparison matrix and recommendations based on conversation insights]

## Quality Criteria for Plans

When developing plans, ensure they are:
- **Actionable**: Clear, specific steps that can be executed
- **Realistic**: Feasible given available resources and constraints
- **Distinct**: Each plan should offer a meaningfully different approach or priority
- **Balanced**: Consider both short-term wins and long-term sustainability
- **Risk-aware**: Address both opportunities and potential pitfalls
- **Measurable**: Include clear success metrics and milestones
